##Building and Using a Dropdown Directive

Bootstrap has the capability to do this with their javascript code, but we don't want to import that because we only want angular to be interacting with the DOM. 

Navigate to the shared folder and add a directive. dropdown.directive.ts

We could use CLI to build the boilerplate. 

import {Directive, HostListener, HostBinding } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appDropdown]'
})

export class DropdownDirective {
  @HostBinding('class.show') isOpen = false;

  @HostListener('click') toggleOpen() {
    this.isOpen = !this.isOpen;
  }

}

In app.module.ts, import the new directive.

import { DropdownDirective } from './shared/dropdown.directive';

Then in whatever HTML file has a dropdown, we find the place where we woul attach the 'open' attribute to begin with.   

attaching the "show" class to the div.  

This should work, but doesn't.
